Martha is 79 years old and has had Type 2 diabetes for 16 years. Her GP conducted a home visit as she was complaining of fatigue, thirst and polyuria. He found blood glucose levels were >25 mmol/L. 

Martha seemed confused, so he bleeped the diabetes team and was advised to admit her to hospital. Her GP stated that Martha seems to have had a general deterioration and been unable to self-care since her husband, her main carer, was admitted to hospital a few days previously.
