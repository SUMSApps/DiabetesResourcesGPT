On arrival you meet Jason, a 19-year-old male who has had Type 1 diabetes for 10 years. He is new to the area, having moved to attend university. 

Jason was brought into emergency department after he was found in a collapsed state by his flatmates, so they called for an ambulance. He had been unwell with tonsillitis for a couple of days prior to admission and had seen the GP for antibiotics. 

Friends brought his Lantus SoloStar and NovoRapid FlexPen insulin pens that they found in his flat into hospital. Friends say Jason is on a basal bolus insulin regimen but are unsure of doses.
